Today's exercise: Big Mac Index

Repo: boolean-uk-js-big-mac-index

Description
Today we're focusing on the basic blocks we've learned this morning: Expressions, Numbers and Variables. 

For that, we're going to build a calculator. But not any calculator, a Big Mac Index Calculator!
Learn more about it here => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index

Instructions
- Use this template as a starting point => https://codesandbox.io/s/big-mac-index-mcrc8?from-embed
- Use the following US Big Mac price as the base currency => US$5.66
- Calculate the index of 5 other countries
- Output each result to the console

Tips
- Before writing any code, think about how you translate the math into code

Challenge
Instead of outputting the index, can you output a boolean that compares two indices that you previously calculated?
Do this for each index you've created before.

Challenge 2
No one likes to look at just numbers! Could you find a way to include useful text in each output?
Use your Google-Fu to find a way to include some useful information to each of the values you're logging!
